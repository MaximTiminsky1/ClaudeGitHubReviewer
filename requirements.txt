# GitHub Pull Request Reviewer - Python Dependencies

# Standard modules used (no installation required):
# - argparse (command-line argument parsing)
# - json (working with JSON data)
# - subprocess (running gh CLI commands)
# - sys (system operations)
# - datetime (working with dates)
# - pathlib (path handling)
# - typing (type hints)
# - re (regular expressions)
# - tempfile (temporary files)
# - os (environment variables)

# External dependencies (non-Python):
# - GitHub CLI (gh) — must be installed and configured
#   Installation: https://cli.github.com/
#   Setup: gh auth login
#
# - Claude Code — used for code analysis via the /review-pr command
#   Download: https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code

# NOTE:
# All dependencies are part of the Python 3.8+ standard library.
# NO additional packages are required!
# Code analysis is performed by the built-in AI in Claude Code,
# so the anthropic SDK is not needed.
